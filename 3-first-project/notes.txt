- will be using vite as our build tool
    - vite compiles our code (optomizations, cache, source mapping, local server)
    - plugins we will use are GLSL support and React

! in vs code makes a super basic html setup


commands run: 
    - npm init -y to initiate node
    - npm install vite
    - npm install threejs


Scenes need four basic elements:
1. Scene - like a container in which we put objects, models, particles, lights, etc
2. Objects - Can be many things like primitive geometries, imported modules, particles, lights, etc
    2a. Mesh = combination of a geormetry and material (shape and look)
    2b. MeshBasicMaterial -  `wireframe: true` can show you wireframes
3. Camera
    3a. needs the field of view (is vertical field of view) expressed in degrees
    3b. aspect ratio (width/height)
    3c. adding the camera is optional but add it to prevent bugs
4. Renderer - The renderer will render the scene seen from the camera's point of view


Object transformation = we can transform objects using
1. position - x, y, z -- z is forward or backward
2. rotation
3. scale

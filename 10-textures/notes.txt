What are textures?
-images that will cover the entire surface of the geometries 
-many types with many different effects
    - we will experiment with common types of textures 
        using door textures by João Paulo 

Displacement textures
- shifts the pixels and can add dimension

Color (albedo)
it will take the pixels of the texture and apply them to the geometry

Alpha
a grayscale image where white will be visible and black wont

Height 
the height texture is a grayscale image that will move the vertices to create some relief
you'll need to add subdivision if you want to see it

Normal
- add details
doesnt need subdivision 
the vertices wont move
lure the light about the face orientation
better performances than adding a height with a lot of subdivision

Ambient Occlusion
grayscale image 
add fake shadows in crevices
not physically accurate
helps create the contrast and see details

Metalness
grayscale image
white is metallic
black is non metallic
mostly for reflection

Roughness
grayscale image
in duo with the metalness
white is rough 
black is smooth
mostly for light dissipation

The textures (especially metalness and roughness follow PBR)
PBR - physcially based rendering
many technics that tend to follow real-life directsion to get realistic results
becoming the standard for realistic renders
many software, engines, and libraries are using it

How to load textures 
one texture loader can load multiple textures

- can provide three functions 
load - when the image loaded successfully
progress - while in progress
error - if something went wrong


LoadingManager
to mutualize events 
its useful to have a global loading tracker or be informed when everything is loaded

UV unwrapping
- flattening texture
- each vertex will have 2d coordinates
we can see those UV coordinates in geometry.attributes.uv

if you create your own geometry you'll have to specify the uv coordinates
even using a 3D software

Transforming textures
repeate property
-Vector2
RepeateWrapping vs MirroredRepeateWrapping
(wrapS values vs wrapT values = 1000 instead of 1002)

current solution for updating offset dynamically is using a instanced buffer
with an indices of texture chunks or with pre computed UVs per instance

Rotation calculations
Math.PI = 1/2 rotation
Math.PI * 2 = full rotation

Filtering and Mipmapping

Mipmapping
recursively creating half a smaller version of a texture until we get a 1x1 texture

minification filter - when the pixels of the texture are smaller than the pixels of the render
- in other words the texture is too big for the surface it covers 

can change how those pixels are getting fetched using the minFilter property
- NearestFilter
- LinearFilter
- NearestMipmapNearestFilter
- NearestMipmapLinearFilter
- LinearMipmapNearestFilter
- LinearMipmapLinearFilter

when pixels get too small you get moiré patterns

sharpens small images when they are stretched
colorTexture.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;

nearest filter improves frame rate
if using NearestFilter for minfilter then we can deactivate minmapping 
    - improves performance

-smaller textures on gpu is better

Texture format and optimization
- when using them we need to consider three things
    - the weight
        - users will have to download the textures (choose right type of file)
        -jpg - lossy compression but usually lighter
        -png - lossless compression but usually heavier
            -can use compression websites and softwares like tinyPNG
    - the size - resolution
        - each pixel of the textures will have to be stored on the gpu regardless of the images weight
        -gpu has storage limitations
        - note mipmapping increases the number of pixels to store

textures support transparency in jpg
- if we want to have only one texture that combine color and alpha we have to use png
    
normal texture you need exact coordinates of pixels
- should use png becuase we dont want lossy compression

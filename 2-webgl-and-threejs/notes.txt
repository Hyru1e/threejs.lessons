- three js works with WebGL, but can make it work with svg and css (limited)

What is WebGL
    - javascript api
    - render triangles quickly 
    - results can be drawn in a `<canvas>`
    - compatible with most modern browsers
    - uses the (GPU) Graphic Processing Unit
    - can be used for 2d (Pixi.js)
    - gpu isnt as fast as cpu but can do them in parallel unlike a single core of the cpu
    - as a simplification - imagine plotting invisible points (instructions)
        - once the points are positioned, the gpu will draw each visible pixel calculated within those points
        - positioning points and pixels are written in shaders
        - there are many variables associated with the concept of shaders 
    - Native WebGL is extremely low level which means a high level of control over memory management

Three js is built on top of WebGL so there is a lot of interaction/customization available

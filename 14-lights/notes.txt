meshstandard material needs light

Ambient light
(color, intensity)
    -omnidirectional lighting 

you can also set the parameters after
ambientLight.color
or 
ambientLight.intensity

we can use ambient light to simulate light bouncing

-by using a regular light and create a smaller dimmer light coming from under the objects 


hemisphere light
you have a sky light and a ground light 
- good for lighting objects 


point light 
- infinitely small point and it lights in all directions 

rect area light
like a photo shoot/having a plane illuminating in a directions
only works with meshstandard material and meshphysicalmaterial 

spotlight
- spotlight .target retrieves a 3d object
you cant adjust that object until you add the object to the scene

lights can be expensive performance wise
- minimal cost lights  
    - ambient
    -hemisphere
moderate cost   
    -directional light
    -point light
high cost
-spotlight
-rectarealight

Baking
- you can bake light into the texture usually recommended to use through 3d software
    - shadows are added into the texture
- drawbacks are you cannot move the light

helpers 
- help us manage positioning of the lights 
- visual aid to see where lights have been placed

pixel ratio 
-- sometimes weird renders can be because of 
    pixel ratios > 1 

    pixel ratio corresponds to how many physical pixels you have on the screen
    to how many you need for the software 

traditionally all screens had a pixel ratio of 1

constructors like apple saw an opportunity and started
building screens with pixel ratio of 2

now some hardware can have pixel ratios of 3+

a pixel ratio of 2 means 4 times more pixels to render
a pixel ratio of 3 means 9 times more pixels to render
highest pixel ratios are usually on the weakest devices
    -mobile

renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio)
- high pixel ratios can cause too many renders so we cap it at 2
renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2));

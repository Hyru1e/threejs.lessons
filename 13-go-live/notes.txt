traditional build
- OVH,1and1 or Gandhi where you upload the files manually by using an FTP client

steps 
1. create a production build - in this case we use vite
2. these files will live under the dist 

- we will use Vercel in this case though / more modern solution 
    - continuous integration 
    - dev friendly
    - easy setup

can also use netlify and github pages

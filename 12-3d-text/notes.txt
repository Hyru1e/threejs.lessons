text is expensive how do we optimize it?
-lower curve segments


Bounding 
bounding is info associated with the geometry that tells what space is taken by that geometry 
we can have box or sphere bounding 
- sphere bounding is default 
textGeometry.computeBoundingBox(); = makes textGeometry.boundingBox available
bevelsize and thickness affect bounding box calculations 

EX: 
  textGeometry.computeBoundingBox();
  textGeometry.translate(
    - (textGeometry.boundingBox.max.x - 0.02) * 0.5,
    - (textGeometry.boundingBox.max.y - 0.02) * 0.5,
    - (textGeometry.boundingBox.max.z - 0.03)  * 0.5
  )

the above can be done using textGeometry.center()
